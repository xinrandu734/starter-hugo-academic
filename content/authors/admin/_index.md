I am a [**PhD student**](https://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Xinran_Du) in psychology at the University of Exeter. Under the supervision of Dr Andrew Livingstone and Dr Anna Adlam, my research focuses on investigating whether the experience of feeling understood by others can help with promoting international studentsâ€™ wellbeing and social inclusion in UK higher education. I am also interested in Open Science, and currently I am an organiser of [**ReproducibiliTea Exeter**](https://osf.io/rmehf/).
